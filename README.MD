# Circus Visual Communication: the digital caption of movement as a tool for graphic design
### Graphic tool for a (non) existing, ephemeral, permanent circus festival

## ABSTRACT

This graphic design research is circus visual communication. It aims to visually represent movement in circus performance, through typography, starting from the spatiotemporal capture of the performer's body.

This research is based on a qualitative non-interventionist and mixed interventionist methodology. The non-interventionist methods of bibliographical research, literature review and case analysis allow to frame the history of circus visual communication, the representation of movement in the visual and performing arts, and the interaction design to create graphics. The interventionist component is developed in the practical project “Graphic tool for a (non) existing, ephemeral and permanent circus festival”, through the exploration of two techniques for capturing movement and the design of ways of acting on body movement over variables graphics, with a focus on typography.

The experimental work process highlights the interaction capabilities of reading and digitally recording movement, not to draw it, but as a generative action that acts on a form and transforms it. The results of this investigation are a set of experimental practices for capturing movement and creating graphics based on the circus techniques, which may be replicated in other performing areas.
